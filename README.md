##Description
This is an analysis of ride share fares from January 1st to May first 2019.  We analysed the difference between Rural, Suburban and Urban environments. We analysed average fare per driver, number of drivers, sum of fares for each city type, total rides for each city type, and the average amount per fare. 

#Average Fare per Driver
Rural:     $55.4 
Suburban:  $39.5
Urban:     $16.5

#Number of Drivers
Rural       78
Suburban    490
Urban       2405

#Sum of Fares for each City Type
Rural:      $4,327.93
Suburban:   $19,356.33
Urban:      $39,854.38

#Total rides for each city type
Rural:       125
Suburban:    625
Urban:       1625

##Average Amount Per Fare
Rural       $55.486282
Suburban    $39.502714
Urban       $16.571468

##Summery
The density of population seems to directly corrolate with the number of drivers and the number of fares.  However, the more dense the population the lower the average fare.  You can expect to increase business according to volume in urban locations, and your fares will be fewer and lower, but your margins for each fare will increase the further you go from urban to rural areas.  All three environments warrant advertising effort to increase the amount of business.  No one environment is superior than the other.  The strategies to get new business will vary depending on the type of environment.
